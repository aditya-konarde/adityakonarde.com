      <description>Hello World!
As we approach the end of the year, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on what I learnt in these 10 years leading to 2020.
I must start off by saying its been such a roller coaster ride. Starting from the early 2010s where I was in ahem School (!) all the way up to now me sitting here in a cafe in my new home - Berlin.</description>

      <description>Hello There TLDR:
Software Engineer - living in Berlin On the side: Amateur Photographer + Music and Coffee enthusiast
Outside of work I only recently discovered that I love travelling and experiencing new cultures.
I&#39;ve been to many countries and will continue to do so. I currently live in Berlin, Germany.
You can find my photography (Travel, Abstract, some random pics) on my Instagram page here: https://www.instagram.com/aditya.konarde/
Other than that, I love good music (almost all genres) and good coffee.</description>
