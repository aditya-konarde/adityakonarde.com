Its development started at <a href=https://soundcloud.com/pages/contact>SoundCloud</a> and it has now evolved into being a go-to choice for metrics collection. I often relate its rise in popularity to its simple, gitops friendly configuration management, simple setup and modularity.</p><p>Prometheus does a few things and does it well. While doing this, it does have some nice modularity as you can mix and match it with other tooling such as <a href=https://github.com/grafana/grafana>Grafana</a> and <a href=https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager>Alertmanager</a>.</p><p>I don't want to make the first paragraph a clickbait. While it was important to set the context, this is <em>not</em> a post that introduces Prometheus itself. Others in the community have done a very good job at doing this, and here's a few recommended talks and blogs about Prometheus if you have some catching up to do.</p><h3 id=prerequisite-reading-a-prometheus-crash-course>Prerequisite reading: A Prometheus crash course</h3><ul><li><a href=https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/>Get an overview</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GMWvFcQjYI">Understand the architecture</a></li><li><a href=https://www.katacoda.com/courses/prometheus/>And please get your hands dirty</a></li></ul><blockquote><p>Again, note that this is a &lsquo;deep dive&rsquo; series. If you're new to Prometheus, I would highly recommend making sure you're familiar with the terminology first with the material above</p></blockquote><h2 id=prometheus-diving-into-the-fire>Prometheus: Diving into the fire</h2><p>When I first started learning to use and set up Prometheus, I faced certain challenges that I don't want other users to see. One of them is the lack of documentation around the details around how Prometheus really works.</p><p>The Prometheus project maintainers are busy people, but I'm hoping to talk to them one at a time and write up a post each on the major subsystems of the codebase.</p><p>Here's an overview of what I currently think the roadmap for the series is going to be. I may add tweaks to this post as my understanding of the project evolves.</p><ul><li>The Prometheus Data Model</li><li>Life cycle of a scrape</li><li>TSDB - The Prometheus time series database layer</li><li>Prometheus Query evaluation</li><li>Alerting walkthrough</li><li>Service Discovery in Prometheus</li><li>Monitoring Prometheus with Prometheus</li></ul><p>And finally here's a disclaimer that I'm not an expert on any of these. I hope to be a gatherer instead, collecting bits of knowledge from everyone's heads and recording it :)</p><p>If you have topic suggestions/requests, please let me know on twitter @aditya_konarde</p><p>A special shoutout to everyone who contributes to this project and have given talks/written content around the Project. I will try to quote them directly as much as I can, but do note if I miss something, all credits belong to whoever they belong to. I have no claims ;)</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://www.adityakonarde.com/posts/provisioning-dashboards-grafana/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
