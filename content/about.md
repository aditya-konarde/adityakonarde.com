# Hello There

TLDR:

Software Engineer - living in Berlin, working on Kubernetes, Prometheus and all things cloud-native

On the side: [Amateur Photographer](https://www.instagram.com/aditya.konarde/) + Music and Coffee enthusiast

## Outside of work

I only recently discovered that I love traveling and experiencing new cultures.

I've been to many countries and will continue to do so. I currently live in Berlin, Germany.

You can find my photography (Travel, Abstract, some random pics) on my [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/aditya.konarde/)

Other than that, I love good music (almost all genres) and good coffee. Still enjoy a good Masala chai though ;)

## Work

I am a Site Reliability Engineer working in the Cloud-native world. Currently focusing on Kubernetes, Prometheus and all the usual SRE stuff. :)

At this point I believe an SRE shuffles between Dev, Ops and Consulting. So I work with whatever language my customer speaks (or codes in). Have done some Python, learning Golang.

Regular conference and meetup speaker. Come say hi!

Other stuff I've worked on: CI/CD, GitOps, Ansible, Observability all for SaaS and business-critical platform backends
