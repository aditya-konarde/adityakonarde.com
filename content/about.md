# About Me

I am an Engineering Leader based in Berlin, Germany, with a passion for building scalable and reliable systems.

My career spans across software engineering, site reliability engineering, and engineering leadership. I currently lead engineering teams at Grafana Labs, where we're building the next generation of observability tools.

I'm an active contributor to the open source community and frequently speak at industry conferences about cloud-native technologies and engineering best practices. I also organize the Kubernetes Berlin meetup, fostering knowledge sharing in the local tech community.

When I'm not working, you can find me:
- Exploring new coffee shops and wine bars
- Enjoying traditional Indian masala chai
- Sharing photography on Instagram
- Engaging in tech discussions on Twitter
