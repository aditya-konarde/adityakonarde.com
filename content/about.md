# Hello There

TLDR:

Software Engineer - living in Berlin
On the side: Amateur Photographer + Music and Coffee enthusiast

## Outside of work

I only recently discovered that I love travelling and experiencing new cultures.

I've been to many countries and will continue to do so. I currently live in Berlin, Germany.

You can find my photography (Travel, Abstract, some random pics) on my Instagram page here: https://www.instagram.com/aditya.konarde/

Other than that, I love good music (almost all genres) and good coffee. Still enjoy a good Masala chai though ;)

## Work

I am Site Reliability Engineer working in the Cloud native world. Currently focusing on Kubernetes, Prometheus and all the usual SRE stuff :)

At this point I believe an SRE shuffles between Dev, Ops and Consulting. So I work with whatever language my customer speaks (or codes in). Have done some Python, learning Golang.

Regular conference and meetup speaker. Come say hi!

Other stuff I've worked on: CI/CD, GitOps, Ansible, Observability all for SaaS and business-critical platform backends

If all of those words sound Greek to you, you're probably not into Software Development :D
