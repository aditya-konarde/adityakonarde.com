# About Me

I am a Software Engineer based in Berlin, Germany. 

My background includes extensive experience with open source, cloud-native technologies. I worked as a Site Reliability Engineer before transitioning into Engineering Leadership, and I currently work as an Engineering Manager at  Grafana labs.

I enjoy sharing my learnings and brainstorming at industry conferences and actively contribute to the tech community as an organizer of the Kubernetes Berlin meetup. I welcome connections at these events and am always eager to engage in meaningful technical discussions.

Outside of work, you will find me trying new types of coffee, wine and enjoying some traditional Indian masala chai.
