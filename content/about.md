# About Me

I am a Technologist (TM) based in Berlin, Germany, with a passion for building scalable and reliable systems involving computers.

My career spans across software engineering, site reliability engineering, and engineering leadership. I currently lead engineering teams at Grafana Labs, where we're building the next generation of observability tools.

I'm an active contributor to the open source community and frequently speak at industry conferences about cloud-native technologies and engineering best practices.

When I'm not working, you can find me:

- Vibe-coding some side projects
- Trying to keep my plants alive
- Learning a new recipe

## 🌐 Work
