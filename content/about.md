# Hello There

I am a Software Engineer currently living in Berlin, Germany. After a few years working on Kubernetes, Prometheus, and other cloud-native technologies as a Site Reliability Engineer, I switched tracks to the world of Engineering leadership. 

In my free time, I am an amateur photographer and enjoy traveling to experience new cultures. You can see some of my work on my Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aditya.konarde/

I also enjoy good music and coffee, and enjoy a good masala chai from time to time.

In addition to my work on Kubernetes and Prometheus, I have experience with CI/CD, GitOps, and Observability. I am a regular conference and meetup speaker and help organize the Kubernetes Berlin meetup so feel free to say hi if you see me at an event.

You can connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityakonarde/

Cheers! :)
