As a software engineer, having the right hardware can make a huge difference in your productivity and success. In this post, I'll share the hardware that I currently use on a daily basis as a remote software engineer.

First and foremost, I use a M1 Macbook Pro for my laptop. This computer is incredibly fast and reliable, which is essential for the work that I do. It also has a beautiful display, which makes it a good laptop for editing pictures. :)

In addition to my laptop, I also use a Dell P2518D monitor as a secondary display. This gives me extra screen real estate and saves my neck and shoulders.

When it comes to my keyboard and mouse, I use a Keychron K1 keyboard and an MX Master 3 mouse for work, and a Logitech G Pro wired mouse for gaming. Both of these peripherals are comfortable to use, and they have all the features that I need for my work and hobbies. I particularly like the high DPI on the gaming mouse, and the 'side button' on the MX master mouse. I use these interchangably. 

For audio, I use a Bose ANC 700 headset for work and Apple Airpods Pro 2 for everyday use. Both of these headphones have excellent sound quality and noise cancellation, which is essential for me since I often have to make calls and attend meetings. I do have a set of Edifier speakers on the desk in case I want to enjoy some music without headhphones. 

For video, I use a Logitech C920 webcam for everyday use, and a Fujifilm XT-4 with an Elgato Camlink 4K for higher quality video. Both of these cameras produce clear and crisp images, which is important for online meetings and video calls.

Finally, I use a Tonor mic for audio recording and podcasting. This microphone has excellent sound quality, and it's very easy to use.

What hardware do you use? I'd love to know! :)
