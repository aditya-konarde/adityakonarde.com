DevConf is an annual developers conference focusing on Open Source software that originally started 10+ years ago in Brno, Czech Republic. In the recent years, the conference is organized in three cities: Brno, Boston and Bangalore.

This was my 3rd time attending the conference in Brno. I definitely missed the snow in Brno, the weather was still quite chill though :)

## Audience

Someone very aptly described the audience of this conference to me in a single sentence: "The audience is college students, Red Hatters, friends of Red Hatters and Open Source developers in the area"

It is obvious from the crowd, every third person you bump into works with Red Hat in some way. Which is pretty cool since its a chance to talk to a wider set of colleagues than what you're usually exposed to.

This time, I also noticed that a bunch of people just interested in using the open source projects were also attending. They made for a good QnA at the end of the talks.

## The Cloud Native technologies booth

All of the cloud native projects together had a large combined booth downstairs in the hallway this year. I'd call it a success for two reasons:

- People were able to understand how different technologies relate to each other
- Having a combined booth made sure that we never ran out of people doing booth duty ;)

Shoutouts to Josh Berkus (@fuzzychef) for this idea.

I spent less time than I anticipated at the booth, mainly because the booth was always well staffed and our volunteers were keeping the audience busy.

In the few short sprints I did there, we talked about Tekton, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Istio, Serverless and other projects. It was really cool to see the OKD4 demo that Diane Muller had put together. I'm excited to try OKD4 sometime soon.

## Talks

I did manage to attend a few talks and decided to watch the recording for others I found interesting. Some key highlights were the following:

### Keynote: SRE - Karanbir Singh, Jeremy Eder, Paul Bergene

I was definitely super hyped for this talk. I have been working with KB and Paul for the last 3 years and it was amazing to see some of the progress we've made being showcased on the big stage.

The Keynote was the first talk on Day 1, so it was hard for anyone to miss. The talk covered various initiatives and developments around how Red Hat is working on delivering software (and clusters!) as a service.

After this talk, I felt like the work being done in the SRE team at Red Hat gained higher visibility to folks outside the team and it kicked off a bunch of interesting hallway conversations.

### What I learnt from x miles of hiking Tim Burke

Tim Burke is the VP of Linux Engineering at Red Hat.
